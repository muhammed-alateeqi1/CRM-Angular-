# CRM App (Customer Relationship Management)

A simple CRM web application built with Angular (Standalone Components) to manage Leads, Customers, and Deals, and visualize business results through a Dashboard.

This project focuses on **clean architecture, clear business flow, and realistic enterprise structure**, rather than heavy features.
